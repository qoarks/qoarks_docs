# qoarks-auth Component

The `<qoarks-auth />` component is the core of the Qoarks frontend library, responsible for managing the entire authentication flow based on your configuration in the Auth Flows section of the dashboard. This component seamlessly handles user login, registration, password reset, and other essential authentication utilities, automatically displaying the appropriate UI elements when necessary.


## Usage Example

Here's how to integrate the component into your application:
```html copy
<qoarks-auth flow_token="YOUR_AUTH_FLOW_TOKEN_HERE"></qoarks-auth>
```

<br />
<br />

# Parameters
The `<qoarks-auth />` component comes with several customizable parameters that allow you to tailor its behavior and appearance to your specific needs:

#### `flow_token` (string):
    - The flow_token is a mandatory string provided in your dashboard. It's crucial as it connects the component to the specific auth flow you’ve configured, ensuring that all the settings—such as branding, security rules, and authentication methods—are correctly applied to the UI generated by the component.

#### `manual` (boolean):
    - By default, the component operates in automatic mode, meaning it will automatically pop up the Login/Register UI when there's no active user session. If the manual parameter is set to true, this automatic behavior is disabled, allowing you to control when and how the authentication UI appears. This is useful if you want to trigger the authentication process programmatically in response to specific events in your app.


#### `background_style` (string):
    - Controls the appearance of the background when the authentication modal is displayed. It supports the following options:
        - **0** : No overlay or popup is created, giving you complete control over the modal's placement and appearance.
        - **1** : Generates a basic overlay with a shadow, providing a simple and clean look.
        - **2** : Creates a full-screen overlay, with the fill color customizable in the dashboard settings.
        - **3** : Produces a full-screen overlay with fun patterns reminiscent of the Qoarks brand, with colors customizable in the dashboard.

#### `password_meter` (boolean):
    - Description: When set to true, this parameter enables a password strength meter within the auth forms. The meter visually indicates the complexity of the password being entered, encouraging users to create stronger, more secure passwords.



# Conclusion
The `<qoarks-auth />` component is designed to make implementing authentication in your app as seamless as possible. With just a few parameters, you can customize the behavior and appearance to fit your app's needs, whether you prefer a hands-off automatic approach or a more controlled, manual integration. As you continue to explore and configure this component, you'll find it flexible enough to handle a wide range of authentication scenarios, ensuring both ease of use and robust security.
