# qoarks-guard Component

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

The `<qoarks-guard>` component is designed to manage content visibility based on the user’s authentication status. It provides two subcomponents, `<qoarks-in>` and `<qoarks-out>`, which allow you to easily control what content is shown to authenticated or non-authenticated users.

## Subcomponents

- `<qoarks-in>` or `<qoarks-logged-in>` in case you prefer clearer naming:

  - Purpose: Restrict content visibility to authenticated users. Anything placed within `<qoarks-in>` will only be visible if the user is logged in.

  - Example

  ```html copy
  <qoarks-in>
  	<button>Logout</button>
  </qoarks-in>
  ```

  ```html copy
  <qoarks-logged-in>
  	<button>Logout</button>
  </qoarks-logged-in>
  ```

  In this example, the **Logout** button will only be displayed to users who are authenticated.

- `<qoarks-out>` or `<qoarks-logged-out>`:

  - Purpose: Display content only to non-authenticated users. Anything inside `<qoarks-out>` will be visible only if the user is not logged in.

  - Example

  ```html copy
  <qoarks-out>
  	<button>Login</button>
  	<button>Register</button>
  </qoarks-out>
  ```

  ```html copy
  <qoarks-logged-out>
  	<button>Login</button>
  	<button>Register</button>
  </qoarks-logged-out>
  ```

  Here, the "Login" and **Register** buttons will be shown only to users who are not authenticated.

## Important note

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  If you are experiencing some flickering at first render, add
  style="display:none;" to both components, that will ensure that initially nothing
  is redered until the components are imported and mounted properly <br />
  example : <br />

      ```html copy
      <qoarks-in style="display:none;">
      	<button>Logout</button>
      </qoarks-in>

      <qoarks-out style="display:none;">
        <button>Login</button>
        <button>Register</button>
      </qoarks-out>
      ```

</Callout>

<br />

## Usage Scenarios

A common use case for these components is to create a dynamic interface where the login and registration options are presented to non-authenticated users, and options like logout are available to authenticated users. This makes `<qoarks-in>` and `<qoarks-out>` particularly useful for creating responsive and secure user interfaces.

## Flexibility and Modularity

The `<qoarks-guard>` component is highly modular and can be adapted to a wide range of scenarios beyond simple login/logout displays. For example, you can use these components to control access to specific features, sections of your app, or even display different navigation menus based on whether a user is logged in.

# Conclusion

The `<qoarks-guard>` component, with its `<qoarks-in>` and `<qoarks-out>` subcomponents, provides a powerful and straightforward way to manage content visibility based on user authentication status. This level of control is essential for building secure, user-friendly applications that adapt to the needs of both authenticated and non-authenticated users.
